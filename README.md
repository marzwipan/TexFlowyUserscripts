# TexFlowyUserscripts
 TexFlowy on Safari, including mobile IOS

 To use, install userscripts for Safari, on your IOS device and/or your Mac.
 https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887

 Put the TexFlowy-with-AsciiMath.js file into your selected userscripts folder.

 Use WFx for Workflowy to install Jay's script to apply custom css:
 https://workflowy.com/s/custom-css-widget/G2phovSRqMglPCnu

 Now use Jay's css script to apply the css stored in the file "Katex CSS.css" to your workflowy, across platforms. These are the fonts KateX needs to display LaTeX.
 Done!
